# TextNoteDimensions Copy right ProBIM
Autodesk Revit add-in developed to determine the dimensions of a TextNote in rotated plan view. 

The add-in works as follows:

1. Pick a point 
2. Pick a textnote
3. The addin then creates a text note at the point with the dimensions of the original textnote

This way we can check the dimensions of a textnote, rotate and check the dimensions again to see if they match.
